                <p>SmartChef is a web application designed to assist users 
                    find new recipes based on the ingredients they have and effortlessly helps them 
                    create the grocery lists for their cooking plans. This application will solve the 
                    common meal planning problems faced by many people as they frequently struggle to 
                    find recipes that work with what they already have at home and/or how to manage their 
                    grocery purchasing properly.  My goal is to make recipe discovery and grocery shopping 
                    more intuitive and well organized in such a way as to simplify meal planning and prevent 
                    food wastage.</p>

                    <h3>Perfect For:</h3>  
                    <p>Tailored to meet the needs for all who enjoys cooking but finds it difficult to decide 
                        what meal to make, those that have limited ingredients at home to make known meal, and those 
                        having issues with meal nutrition decisions. It will be particularly useful for:</p>
